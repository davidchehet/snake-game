# 🐍 Snake Game

Project #1 of my journey learning C++! Built a classic snake game to get familiar with C++ basics, classes, and game loops.

## What I Used

- C++
- Raylib (graphics library)
- Some sound effects to make it feel real

## Running It

1. Install Raylib (I used `brew install raylib` on Mac)
2. Compile: I ran `Cmd + Shift + B` on Mac to build, and selected `link raylib`.
3. Run: `./build/app`

Use arrow keys to play. Don't hit the walls or yourself!

## What I Learned

- C++ syntax
- Object-oriented programming with classes (Snake, Food, Game)
- Using deques for the snake body segments
- Game loops and timing
- Handling user input
- Basic collision detection
